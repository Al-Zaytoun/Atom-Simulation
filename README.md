Work in progress of an Atom Simulation project.

Currently, the stage I am working on, is changing from a standard 2D window towards using JOGL to create a 3D window. The plan is to replace the current SimulationPanel, which is used as a basic 2D implementation, and will need to be redrawn in a 3D manner for openGL.
